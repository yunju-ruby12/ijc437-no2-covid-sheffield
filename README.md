📊 NO₂ Variation Before, During, and After COVID-19
Devonshire Green Monitoring Station, Sheffield (2018–2023)

This project investigates how hourly nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) concentrations changed across three key periods: pre-COVID (2018), during COVID (2020), and post-COVID (2023).

Using openly available UK-AIR monitoring data, the analysis explores inter-annual differences, seasonal patterns, and diurnal (hourly) variation in urban air pollution.

## Research Questions

**RQ1:** How did overall NO₂ concentrations differ between the pre-COVID (2018), COVID (2020), and post-COVID (2023) periods?

**RQ2:** What seasonal and diurnal (hourly) patterns can be identified across the three study periods?

---

## Key Findings

- Annual NO₂ concentrations declined progressively from 2018 to 2023.
- Variability and extreme high-concentration events also decreased over time.
- Seasonal patterns remained consistent: higher concentrations in winter, lower in summer.
- Diurnal structure persisted across all years, with morning and evening peaks.
- Overall pollution intensity changed, but temporal dynamics remained structurally stable.
