Analysis of hourly NO2 concentrations in Sheffield across pre-, during-, and post-COVID periods (2018, 2020, 2023).
# NO2 COVID Sheffield Project

## Project Overview

This project investigates hourly nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) concentrations at the Devonshire Green monitoring station in Sheffield across three representative years: 2018 (pre-COVID), 2020 (COVID period), and 2023 (post-COVID). 

The aim is to examine how overall concentration levels changed across these periods and to identify consistent seasonal and diurnal patterns in urban air pollution.

## Research Questions

**RQ1:** How did overall NO₂ concentrations differ between the pre-COVID (2018), COVID (2020), and post-COVID (2023) periods?

**RQ2:** What seasonal and diurnal (hourly) patterns can be identified across the three study periods?

---

## Key Findings

- Annual NO₂ concentrations declined progressively from 2018 to 2023.
- Variability and extreme high-concentration events decreased over time.
- Seasonal patterns (higher winter concentrations, lower summer concentrations) remained consistent across all three years.
- Diurnal patterns showed persistent morning (07:00–10:00) and evening (18:00–22:00) peaks.
- While overall concentration levels declined, the temporal structure of NO₂ variability remained stable.

## Data Source

Hourly NO₂ monitoring data were obtained from the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) UK-AIR platform.

Monitoring site:
Devonshire Green, Sheffield (city centre urban background site).

## Repository Structure


- `R/` contains the data cleaning and analysis scripts.
- `data_raw/` contains the original downloaded datasets.
- `data_intermediate/` contains partially cleaned datasets (e.g., selected variables such as date, time, NO₂).
- `data_clean/` contains processed datasets generated by the cleaning script.
- `outputs/` contains exported figures and summary tables used in the report.

## How to Run the Code

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the project in RStudio.
3. Install required packages:

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("lubridate")
```
4. Run the scripts in order:

- R/01_data_cleaning.R
- R/02_analysis.R

5. Outputs will be generated automatically in the outputs/ folder.

Reproducibility Notes
- Missing values were not imputed.
- All results and visualisations are generated programmatically from the raw datasets.
- The workflow is structured and fully reproducible.
