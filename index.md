# NO₂ Concentration Analysis – Sheffield

## Overview

This project investigates how urban NO₂ concentrations changed before, during, and after COVID-19 using hourly monitoring data from Devonshire Green, Sheffield.

The analysis combines time-series exploration, distribution comparison, seasonal analysis, and diurnal pattern identification.

---

## Research Questions

- How did overall NO₂ levels change across 2018, 2020, and 2023?
- Do seasonal and daily (hourly) patterns remain consistent across periods?

---

## Key Insights

- Clear reduction in mean NO₂ levels from 2018 to 2023.
- Reduced variability and fewer extreme high-concentration events.
- Persistent winter peaks and summer lows.
- Stable morning (07:00–10:00) and evening (18:00–22:00) pollution peaks.

Although overall concentration levels declined, the temporal structure of urban NO₂ variability remained stable.
